## Donate:
**"Giving is not just about making a donation. It is about making a difference" - Kathy Calvin**


**Donating is another way you can support this cause. By donating you provide the resources necessary to continue to help people in need. Donating is not mandatory so don't feel pressured to donate. But, if you do donate just know that a little goes a long way.**
