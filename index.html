          Hi, my name is Kai Denmark; thank you for visiting my web page :) I just
          want to take a moment to explain the purpose of this website and how it came about.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted fs-6">
          During Trump’s presidency, the refugee resettlement rate dropped sharply due to a
          much lower ceiling put on refugee acceptance and admission rates. The situation has
          always been bleak, but it got worse thanks to regulations and restrictions the former president
          put in place. So, I decided I wanted to do something about it. On this webpage you will find
          resources that will help you educate and enlighten you about these problems. There is also
          information on how to donate and take action. This will help organizations further their
          ability to help others that are struggling, because immigrants and refugees are suffering
          due to forced family separation, harsh restrictions (such as the zero tolerance policy), and
          a general sense of not being welcomed into this country. So, please take time to think about
          these people because they deserve a chance too. And, don't feel pressured to donate, you can
          help in other ways like spreading the word or writing a letter to your elected official.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-muted fs-6">
          Anyways, thank you for visiting my web page and have a great day! &ndash; Kai

        Educating oneself is one of the first steps to making change. Learning about what has
        been happening and increasing awareness by spreading the word is very powerful. I invite
        you to learn about this situation through these articles that really show the true extent
        of this issue.

        Writing a letter and telling elected leaders how you feel is another way to support immigrants
        and refugees. I invite you to tell your elected officials how you feel about how immigrants and
        refugees are being treated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Find out how to contact your elected official or the President and express how you feel in a letter.

        Donating money or goods is another way you can support this cause. By giving a charitable
        contribution you provide the resources necessary to continue to help people in need. Although
        it's not required, if you do donate just know that a little goes a long way.
