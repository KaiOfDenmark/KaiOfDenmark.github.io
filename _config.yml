description: Hi, my name is Kai Denmark thank you for visiting this web page :) I just want to take a bit of your time to explain the point of this whole web page and the idea behind it. Hopefully you wonâ€™t mind. In the past couple of years thanks to Donald Trump being president of the United States the state of refugee acceptance has been really bad thanks to increased border police and turn away rates. The situation has always been bleak but it's getting even worse. So, I decided I wanted to do something about it. On this webpage you will find resources that will help you educate and enlighten you to these problems. There is also information on how to donate and take action. This will help organizations further their ability to help others that are struggling, because especially now Immigrants and Refugees are suffering due to separation, harsh restrictions, not being welcomed, and being in a new place that they aren't familiar with. So, please take time to think about these people because they deserve a chance too. And, don't feel pressured to donate, you can help in other ways like spreading the word or writing a letter to your elected official. Anyways, thank you for visiting my web page and have a great day! Kai
