            Hi, my name is Kai Denmark thank you for visiting this web page :) I just
            want to take a bit of your time to explain the point of this whole web page
            and the idea behind it. Hopefully you won’t mind. In the past couple of years
            thanks to Donald Trump being president of the United States the state of
            refugee acceptance has been really bad thanks to increased border police and
            turn away rates. The situation has always been bleak but it's getting even worse.
            So, I decided I wanted to do something about it. On this webpage you will find
            resources that will help you educate and enlighten you to these problems. There
            is also information on how to donate and take action. This will help organizations
            further their ability to help others that are struggling, because especially now
            Immigrants and Refugees are suffering due to separation, harsh restrictions, not
            being welcomed, and being in a new place that they aren't familiar with. So, please
            take time to think about these people because they deserve a chance too. And, don't
            feel pressured to donate, you can help in other ways like spreading the word or writing
            a letter to your elected official. Anyways, thank you for visiting my web page and have
            a great day! Kai

        Educating oneself is one of the first steps to making change. Learning about what
        has been happening and spreading the word is very powerful. I invite you to learn
        about the organizations we support with this website.

        Learning about what others have done can inspire people, I know it inspired me, so take
        a little time to read about other people doing good in this world.

        Donating is another way you can support this cause. By donating you provide the resources necessary
        to continue to help people in need. Donating is not mandatory so don't feel pressured to donate. But,
        if you do donate just know that a little goes a long way.
