###### Kai's Bar Mitzvah Project


#### My Mission


**Hi, my name is Kai Denmark thank you for visiting this web page :) I just want to take a bit of your time to explain the point of this whole web page and the idea behind it. Hopefully you won’t mind. In the last couple of years thanks to Trump being president of the United States the state of refugee acceptance has been really bad. I mean it’s never been good but it’s just gotten worse. So, I decided I wanted to do something about it. On this webpage you will find links to important information so that you can educate yourself and act. There is also a link to donate and take action to help organizations further their ability to help others that are struggling, because especially now these people are suffering due to separation, harsh restrictions, and being in a new place that they aren’t necessarily familiar with. So, please take time to think about these people because they deserve a chance too. You don’t even have to donate (though that would be epic) just educating yourself and spreading the word is great, anyways thanks! Kai**
